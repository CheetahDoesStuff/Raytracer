whGame Engine 🎮

A lightweight game engine written entirely in WHEN language, demonstrating the power and elegance of WHEN's conditional paradigm for game development.
🌟 Features

    Pure WHEN Implementation - No Python game code, just WHEN!
    Sprite Management - Create, move, and delete game sprites
    Collision Detection - Built-in AABB collision system
    Keyboard Input - Real-time keyboard event handling
    Implicit Game Loop - Leverages WHEN's main loop paradigm
    Color Support - Hex and named color support
    Window Management - Easy window creation and configuration

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

    WHEN Language interpreter installed
    Python 3.8+ (for the WHEN interpreter)
    tkinter (usually comes with Python)

Installation

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/PhialsBasement/whGame-WHEN-Language-Game-Engine.git
cd whGame-Engine

    Copy whGame.when to your WHEN project directory or ensure it's in the same directory as your game file.

Your First Game

Create a file my_game.when:

import whGame

player = None
player_x = 300
player_y = 300

main:
    # Initialize once
    when not whGame.initialized:
        whGame.init_engine(600, 400, "My First Game", "#000033")
        player = whGame.create_sprite(player_x, player_y, 40, 40, "#00FF00", "player")

    # Game loop
    when whGame.initialized and whGame.running:
        # Handle input
        when whGame.is_key_pressed("left"):
            player_x = player_x - 5
            whGame.move_sprite(player, -5, 0)

        when whGame.is_key_pressed("right"):
            player_x = player_x + 5
            whGame.move_sprite(player, 5, 0)

        # Update display
        whGame.update_display()
        sleep(0.016)  # 60 FPS

    # Exit on ESC
    when whGame.is_key_pressed("escape"):
        whGame.stop_game()
        exit()

Run your game:

python when.py my_game.when

📚 API Reference
Initialization
init_engine(width, height, title, bg_color)

Initialize the game engine and create a window.

    width: Window width in pixels
    height: Window height in pixels
    title: Window title string
    bg_color: Background color (hex string or color name)

Sprites
create_sprite(x, y, width, height, color, tag)

Create a new sprite.

    Returns: Sprite object with properties x, y, width, height, color, tag

move_sprite(sprite, dx, dy)

Move a sprite by delta values.
set_sprite_position(sprite, x, y)

Set absolute position of a sprite.
delete_sprite(sprite)

Remove a sprite from the game.
Input
is_key_pressed(key)

Check if a key is currently pressed.

    Common keys: "left", "right", "up", "down", "space", "escape", "a"-"z", "0"-"9"

Collision
check_collision(sprite1, sprite2)

Check if two sprites are colliding using AABB detection.

    Returns: True if colliding, False otherwise

on_collision(tag1, tag2, handler_function)

Register a collision handler for sprites with specific tags.

    handler_function: Called with (sprite1, sprite2) when collision occurs

Display
update_display()

Refresh the game display. Call this each frame.
draw_text(x, y, text, color, font)

Draw text on screen.

    font: Optional tuple like ("Arial", 20)

clear_canvas()

Clear all sprites from the display.
Game Control
stop_game()

Stop the game loop and close the window.
Properties

    whGame.initialized: Boolean, true after init_engine
    whGame.running: Boolean, true while game is active
    whGame.window_width: Current window width
    whGame.window_height: Current window height

🎮 Example Games
Asteroid Blaster

A classic space shooter where you defend against falling asteroids.

python when.py examples_asteroid.when

Controls:

    Arrow Keys: Move left/right
    Space: Fire bullets
    ESC: Exit

Space Shooter

A vertical scrolling shooter with enemy waves.

python when.py examples_space.when

Controls:

    Arrow Keys: Move left/right
    Space: Shoot
    ESC: Exit

🏗️ Architecture

whGame leverages WHEN language's unique features:
Implicit Game Loop

main:
    when whGame.initialized and whGame.running:
        # This runs every frame automatically!
        update_game()
        whGame.update_display()

Conditional Game Logic

# No if/else needed!
when player.health <= 0:
    game_over = True

when game_over:
    display_game_over_screen()

when not game_over:
    continue_gameplay()

Error-Free Collision Handling

# Using WHEN's safe_call for robust collision detection
collision_result = safe_call(whGame.check_collision, player, enemy)

when is_success(collision_result) and get_result(collision_result):
    handle_player_hit()

🔧 Advanced Features
Custom Collision Handlers

def on_bullet_hits_enemy(bullet, enemy):
    score = score + 10
    whGame.delete_sprite(bullet)
    whGame.delete_sprite(enemy)

whGame.on_collision("bullet", "enemy", on_bullet_hits_enemy)

Sprite Velocity System

# Set sprite velocity
whGame.set_sprite_velocity(enemy, 0, 2)  # Move down at 2 pixels/frame

# Update all sprites with velocity
whGame.update_all_sprites_physics()

Game State Management

game_state = "menu"

main:
    when game_state == "menu":
        show_menu()
        when whGame.is_key_pressed("space"):
            game_state = "playing"

    when game_state == "playing":
        run_game()
        when player_lives == 0:
            game_state = "game_over"

    when game_state == "game_over":
        show_game_over()
        when whGame.is_key_pressed("r"):
            reset_game()
            game_state = "menu"

🙏 Acknowledgments

    Built for the WHEN Language
    Inspired by classic game engines but reimagined in WHEN's unique paradigm

🐛 Known Limitations

    No audio support (WHEN language limitation)
    Basic shapes only (rectangles)
    No image/sprite sheet support (WHEN uses colored rectangles)
    Single window only
    No fullscreen mode

🚦 Roadmap

    Sprite rotation
    Particle effects system
    Multiple collision shapes
    Scene management
    Save/Load game state
    Networking support for multiplayer
    Performance optimizations
    Mobile touch input support

Made with ❤️ in WHEN Language

Remember: In WHEN, everything is a condition, even your game loop!
